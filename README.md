# Ture

Ture is a collection of algorithms and data structures written in TypeScript for fun and profit.

**WTF does Ture mean?** Essentially, it's a famous **sicilian** personal name, but it's contained in the word strucTUREs and remembers Alan Turing as well, so why not.

Beware that some algorithms and data structure aren't really optimized for production use, so please take this into account before depending on this package. At the moment I'm using it on personal small projects, especially small video game demos.
